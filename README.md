ComicsDB
========

<h2>An open design for a comics database system</h2>

This space has been created for the design and implementation of a comic book database stemming from the research of my masters thesis done for the School of Information and Library Science at The University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill's masters of information science program. To better understand the underlying research, please read the thesis as provided in the documentation.

Structure
=========

A .sql file containing create table statements for all tables in the database is provided. As time goes on, a full mysqldump of the database will be added as time goes on.

The frontend for the database is being built with PHP, mostly using the `mysqli` methodology. Milestones have been set for the different sections of pages that need to be created, as well as the style information and further enhancements to be implemented with javascript/jquery/ajax.

Contributor's Guidelines
========================

All contributions are welcome! Please familiarize yourself with the research and intents of the project, as well as the milestones set to understand the goals of the design.
